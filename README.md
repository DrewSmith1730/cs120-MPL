## My project as a whole
For this open project I decided to do a basic 'encryption' project. However the term encryption is being used very loosly here.
To do the encryption I am simply adding to the value of each char in each word. This is why I chose to do this part in c++ as it would handle this the fastest.
Simply because the way I am doing it is very basic and simple the standards of encryption are very high and this would not even come close to them.
The main point of this was to use python for user input and c++ for file manipulation.
I passed three variables from the python to the c++ to make this happen.

## How my program works
A lot this is decribed when you run the program. However I will put it here too.
So you take file you want to 'encrypt' and ensure it is in the folder for this project.
Then you answer the prompts entering the file name correctly and a number of times you want to loop the encryption
This is done as a simple way to add extra security. This number is important with out it you cant decrypt properly.
